**Keras wheels**

Instructor: Mehdi Mahmoodi

## Prerequisites

You must already have knowledge of basic statistics, Machine Learning, and Linear Algebra to succeed in this course.

## Introduction

This repo covers various Deep Learning techniques to design a model in keras. A number of well-defined data mining tasks such as Linea Regression, classification, estimation, prediction are discussed. 

## Project: Python works
