**Keras wheels**

Instructor: Mehdi Mahmoodi

## Prerequisites

You must already have knowledge of basic statistics, Machine Learning, and Linear Algebra to succeed in this course.

## Introduction

This repo covers various Deep Learning techniques to design a model in keras. A number of well-defined data mining tasks such as Linea Regression, classification, estimation, prediction are discussed. 

##
Data mining supports decision making by detecting patterns, devising rules, identifying new decision alternatives and making predictions. This course is organized around a number of well-defined data mining tasks: description, classification, estimation, prediction, and affinity grouping and clustering.  Students will learn to use techniques such as Rule Induction (classification trees), Logistic Regression, and Discriminant Analysis. Data visualization techniques will be used whenever possible to reveal patterns and relationships.  Students will use commercially available software tools to mine large databases.

The course is organized into 3 broad areas as follows:

1)      Context/Data: Decision Support for Strategic Decision-making.  Preliminary data analysis

2)      Predictive Analytics: Predictive models and evaluation: Discriminant Analysis, Trees

3)      Segmentation/Association: Techniques like Clustering and Market Basket analysis.

**Learning Outcomes/Course Objectives**

Upon completion of the course, students will be able to work on real-life projects using relatively large datasets, to build and evaluate prediction and classification models, and segment populations.

 

Specifically, students will learn to:

1.       Apply analytics techniques within a general framework for decision support within organizations.

2.       Interpret business requirements, organization structure, and translate that into data mining projects that help an organization meet their decision support needs.

3.       Collect data, perform preliminary analyses including data aggregation, variable creation/transformation, and data cleaning.

4.       Split data into training and validation samples. Use visual techniques to describe data.

5.       Create Cross-tabulations for bivariate analysis.

6.       Explain in your own words the assumptions of various techniques such as Cluster Analysis, Multiple Regression, Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks.

7.       Build multiple regression, discriminant analysis, and Logistic models for forecasting.

8.       Validate classification models using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test.                      

9.       Interpret the output of Classification tree algorithms like CART and CHAID.

10.   Segment data using Cluster Analysis, and interpret the output.

11.   Discuss issues of implementation of the results of various techniques.

12.   Develop methods to monitor the ongoing performance of implemented models.

13.   Present an analytics project report to top management in plain language, with implications for business decision making clearly stated.
